    <h4>How To have something repaired</h4>
    <p>
        If you have an item that needs to be repaired, access our @Html.ActionLink("Repair My Item", "Create", "Jobs") page, where you can
        list the job you need completed, and submit it to our repair members.
    </p>
    <h4>What next?</h4>
    <p>You'll be able to check on your job, and see if it's been claimed, activated, or completed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Claimed: A repair memeber has chosen to take up your repair. It has been added to their Job Queue.</li>
        <li>Activated: Our repair memeber has completed other jobs, and your is next in line or underway.</li>
        <li>Completed: Your repair has been completed marked done by our repair member.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once your job in completed, you have no further responsibility. In fact, you can freely @Html.ActionLink("check on the status", "Public", "Jobs") of all repairs,
        and see which repair memebers are taking them on.

        @*actionlinks to register account , worker create,jobs index and worker index*@
        To become a repair member, you'll need to create an @Html.ActionLink("Account", "Register", "Account") and register as a @Html.ActionLink("Worker", "Create", "Workers").
        To create an account, you won't need to include your name, but to register as a worker, we'll need your first and last name, which will be freely visible.
    </p>
    <p>Once you're a repair memeber, you'll have access to the @Html.ActionLink("Worker Dashboard", "Index", "Jobs"), where you can see a list of jobs, and claim jobs to add to your @Html.ActionLink("Queue", "Index", "Worker").</p>
